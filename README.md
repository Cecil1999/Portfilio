# Portfolio

This repo was mean't to be forked, copied, etc...

**DO NOT TRY AND MERGE YOUR OWN INFORMATION**

## Introduction.

We all start somewhere, and rather than using some for of website builder for a portfolio. I opted to try and create my own.

Fair warning, I am a Back-End developer, and do _NOT_ have much experience with Tailwind. This project was a stepping stone for me. If you have tips, tricks or general fixes (nothing that includes your own information) and create a PR I will merge it.

The main page, and any other page _should_ use a simplistic structure that can be extrated easily by AI bots companies use to grab and summerize information.
